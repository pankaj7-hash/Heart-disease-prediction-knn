❤️ Heart Disease Prediction using K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
📌 Project Overview

This project predicts the presence of heart disease using the K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) classification algorithm on the UCI Heart Disease dataset.

The goal is to build a machine learning model that can assist in early risk identification using clinical and demographic features.
